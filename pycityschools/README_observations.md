## After the data analysis was performed there are few interesting trends that could be seen as follows:



### Top Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)

* Observation: the top performing schools are all Charter schools.

### Bottom Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)

* Observation: the bottom performing schools are all District schools.

### Scores by School Spending

* Observation: There is an interesting trend showing that with increasing the amount to spend per student, all scores are actually going down, which means that increasing the budget doesn't necesserary brings better results

### Scores by School Size

* Observation: Based on the size of the school a trend could be seen that the smaller the school, the better results. Schools with over 2000 students have much lower Overall Passing score and their Average math score is at least 6% lower than the smaller schools.

### Scores by School Type

* Observation: Charter schools are perfroming much better results than the District schools. The "Overall passing" results are showing a significant difference between both types of schools Charter at 90.43% and District at 53.67%
