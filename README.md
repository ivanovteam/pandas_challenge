# Pandas Project
####

This project is an analysis of the schools in a district.
It shows different trends and results based on the students' results from passing math ans reading tests.
It is interesting that based on the type of the school, the budget per student and the size of the school the results vary 
and the biggest school with the higher budget not always produce the best results.
